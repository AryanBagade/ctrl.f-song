# SeekTune - Advanced Audio Recognition System

SeekTune is a sophisticated audio recognition system that identifies songs from audio recordings using advanced digital signal processing and machine learning techniques. The system employs acoustic fingerprinting technology to match audio samples against a comprehensive database of known tracks.

## üöÄ Overview

SeekTune leverages cutting-edge audio analysis algorithms to extract unique acoustic fingerprints from audio recordings. These fingerprints serve as digital signatures that enable rapid and accurate song identification, even from partial or noisy recordings.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

**Backend Engine (Go)**
- High-performance audio processing engine
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- SQLite database for fingerprint storage
- RESTful API endpoints for song management

**Frontend Interface (React)**
- Intuitive web-based user interface
- Real-time audio recording capabilities
- Live recognition feedback
- Song library management dashboard

**Audio Processing Pipeline**
- Digital signal processing modules
- Spectrogram generation and analysis
- Peak detection algorithms
- Acoustic fingerprint extraction

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) with high-performance concurrent processing
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern UI components
- **Database**: SQLite for efficient fingerprint storage and retrieval
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time data exchange
- **Audio Processing**: Custom DSP implementations with FFT algorithms

## üî¨ Audio Recognition Process

### 1. Audio Preprocessing
The system begins by preprocessing incoming audio data:
- **Digital Signal Filtering**: Audio signals are passed through a low-pass filter to remove frequencies above 5kHz, focusing on the most characteristic frequency range for music identification
- **Downsampling**: Audio is downsampled to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential harmonic information
- **Windowing**: Hamming window functions are applied to minimize spectral leakage during frequency analysis

### 2. Spectrogram Generation
Audio data is transformed into the frequency domain using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):
- **FFT Processing**: Implements recursive Fast Fourier Transform for efficient frequency domain conversion  
- **Time-Frequency Representation**: Creates detailed spectrograms showing how frequency content evolves over time
- **Frequency Binning**: Organizes spectral data into discrete frequency bins for systematic analysis

### 3. Peak Detection and Feature Extraction
The system identifies significant acoustic features:
- **Multi-Band Analysis**: Frequency spectrum is divided into multiple bands (0-10Hz, 10-20Hz, 20-40Hz, 40-80Hz, 80-160Hz, 160-512Hz)
- **Peak Identification**: Detects local maxima in each frequency band that exceed statistical thresholds
- **Temporal Mapping**: Associates each detected peak with precise timing information

### 4. Acoustic Fingerprinting
Creates unique digital signatures for audio content:
- **Constellation Mapping**: Pairs anchor points with target points to create acoustic landmarks
- **Hash Generation**: Generates 32-bit hash addresses combining frequency and temporal information
- **Address Encoding**: Encodes anchor frequency, target frequency, and time delta into compact binary representations
- **Fingerprint Database**: Stores millions of fingerprints enabling rapid cross-referencing

### 5. Pattern Matching and Recognition
Matches unknown audio against the fingerprint database:
- **Hash Lookup**: Queries database for matching fingerprint addresses
- **Temporal Alignment**: Analyzes time offset patterns to identify consistent matches
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates match confidence based on fingerprint correlation strength
- **Result Ranking**: Orders potential matches by statistical significance and temporal consistency

## üìä Database Schema

### Songs Table
Stores metadata for indexed audio tracks:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each song
- **Title**: Song title extracted from metadata
- **Artist**: Artist name from audio file tags
- **YouTube ID**: Associated YouTube video identifier for streaming
- **Key**: Composite unique key for duplicate detection

### Fingerprints Table
Houses acoustic fingerprint data:
- **Address**: 32-bit hash representing acoustic features
- **Anchor Time**: Temporal position of the anchor point (milliseconds)
- **Song ID**: Reference to the source song
- **Composite Primary Key**: Ensures fingerprint uniqueness across the database

## üéµ Supported Audio Formats

The system processes multiple audio formats:
- **WAV**: Uncompressed audio for highest quality analysis
- **MP3**: Compressed audio with metadata support
- **FLAC**: Lossless compression maintaining audio fidelity
- **M4A**: Advanced Audio Coding format
